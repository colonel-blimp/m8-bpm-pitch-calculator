A PWA M8 Tempo/Pitch Change calculator

![TPO2PIT](src/img/tpo2pit_256.png)

## Overview

This app is a web-based calculator that takes two BPMs, figures out the pitch
change between them, and displays the results as values for various FX commands
for the [Dirtywave M8].  It's a [PWA], so you can install it locally and use it
offline.

This is helpful if you chop samples and re-pitch them on the M8 to match a
given tempo (jungle-style).  The M8 provides several methods to do this, but
each one involves a second conversion to a hexdecimal valueâ€“and the numbering
systems are different for each one.
